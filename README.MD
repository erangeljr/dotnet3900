#README.MD

A rewrite of an upper division Computer Science course that originally used Jave. It is
being rewritten using C# and the .Net runtime.

C# in an academic institutions is almost not existant due to many universities focus on unix
 and unix like operating systems and therefore programming environments. 
 
 Over the last several years I have taught at both the Community College and State University 
 Systems. I am ver eager to introduce students to an additional tool set.
