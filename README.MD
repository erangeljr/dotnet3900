#README.MD

A rewrite of Dr. Huaqing Wang Computer Science 394 course using C# and the .Net Core 1.0 runtime.

C# in an academic institutions is almost not existant due to many universities focus on unix
 and unix like operating systems and therefore programming environments. 
 
 Over the last several years I have taught at both the Community College and State University 
 Systems. I am ver eager to introduce students to this emerging tool set.
