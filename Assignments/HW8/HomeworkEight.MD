###I.	Goals and Related Techniques:
	
    Get familiar with Android Studio and Hand-held dvice programming.

###II.	Installation

   - Install Android Studio on your personal computer, either IBM PC or Mac.
     If you have install old version of Android Studion, I suggest update it.

   - Use CSUB libray and/or internet to find book or resources to learn programming
     Android. 

###III. Write a Android Program on Any Topic

    Here is an example program:

     In big parking lot, people forget where they parked the car. The  program will
solve that problem by providing the following features or functionalities:

     1. Save the current location: When this function is invoked, the current point (
        logitude and attitude are save in SQLite ( a very light SQL Database Mangement
        System coming with any Android operating system).

     2. Find out my Car: When app is running and the Find function is invoked, the google
        map is displayed and show two points on the map. the firt point is the current
        location, and second point is the location where you parked your car and saved
        by the functon specicified in step 1.

    3. Optionally, you may drop a line or map to show how to get to your car.
