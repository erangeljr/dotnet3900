I.	Goals and Related Techniques:

    1. Read the three classic synchronization problems:
        producer-consuer, smoker-problem and rive-cossing probelm.

    2. Understand
        -  Shared memory and mutual exclusion, and critical sections 
        - C#'s support/tools for mutual exclusion: synchronized data and/or function members.
        - Monitor : A class with shared memory and synchronized data and mainly synchronized methods.
                    The syncrhonized methods are so-called critical sections.

        - C# support for syncronizations:
            mutual exclusion,
            wait(), wait( miniSeconds ), notify(), notifyAll()
            join(),
            pipedIO can be used as synchronzation tool as we have done in homework 4.

   3. Understand applicaton and applet:

        - What is a C# application?
        - What is a C# applet?
        - Write a program which can be run as application and as applet.

   4. Understand the basics of C# graphical user interface.

   5. Basic C# 2D drawing.
	 

II.	Assignment Description

    Update the river-crossing program so that 

        1. the dogs and cats are crosing river in the right order.
        2. program looks better.
